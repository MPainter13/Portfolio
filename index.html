                My name is Magdalena and you’re viewing my portfolio page. Before you get to my work, I’d like to tell
                you a little about myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                I’m currently studying to be a front end web developer. We all enjoy the convenience and fun things the
                internet has to offer but I was really intrigued by the work my cousin and her husband do and wanted to
                learn more about how the web actually works. So here I am…
            </p>
            <p>
                I was born in Poland and immigrated to the USA in 2011. As you might imagine, moving to a new country,
                learning a new language, and leaving behind all the things I ever knew, was quite a challenge. But I’m
                not one to shy away from a challenge. I overcame many obstacles and am proud to say that, in a
                relatively short time, I was able to adjust to life here, make friends, find a job, even get married and
                start a family. When the opportunity came to immerse myself in something new I jumped at it!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am excited to be on this journey of learning new things and being able to apply them in a professional
                manner. I hope you enjoy my work and if you have any comments or questions I’d love to hear from you so
                please feel free to use the contact link and send me a message!
            </p>
